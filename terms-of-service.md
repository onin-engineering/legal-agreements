# Our Terms of Service

Effective date: 18/09/2023

## Welcome to OurCal

Thank you for using OurCal! We hope you enjoy using the App to securely share calendars with your groups.

Privacy and Security are at the centre of OurCal and these terms and our [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy.md) explain how we look after your data to ensure its safety and security.

## Who we are and what this agreement does

We, Onin Ltd. of 128 City Road, London EC1V 2NX, license you to use:

* OurCal App mobile application software, the data supplied with the software, (**App**) and any updates or supplements to it.
* The service you connect to via the App and the content we provide to you through it (**Service**).

Depending on the version of the App you have installed, your use of the App may also be controlled by Apple’s rules and policies and these rules and policies will apply instead of these terms where there are differences between the two.
 
## Getting started

**Registering**. To use the App, you must first register to use our Service by providing us with your name and verify that you are at least 13 years old. We may send you a code to your email to complete the registration and you agree to us using your email in this way. In registering, you identify a profile, by which you will be known to other users you share groups with as.

**Age**. You must be at least 13 years old to use our App and Services.

**Data Connections**. To use OurCal you need to have a data connection from your device. This enables you to chat and arrange dates with your contacts and also allows OurCal to send updates, alerts and other information to you.

**Your device**. To use the App, you need to download it onto your device. The App will only work on the most current (and current minus two) versions of the iOS device operating system. You give us permission to send notifications and data to your device.

**Your device calendars and contacts**. You can choose to allow the App to connect to your device calendars to show you such calendar events in the App. If you do, you give your consent to do that. You can also choose to allow the App to connect to your device contacts to show you which of these contacts are also OurCal users and, if you do, you give your consent to do that.

**Cost**. If you use the free version of OurCal, we won’t charge you to use OurCal. If you use one of our paid for plans, then you will be charged the fees relevant to that plan. In all cases, you are responsible for any Internet fees, carrier data plans and other costs from third parties that you may be charged to connect to our services.

## Support for the app and how to tell us about problems

**Support**. If you want to learn more about the App or the Service or have any problems using them please contact us using the details below.

**Contacting us (including with complaints)**. If you think the App or the Services are faulty or misdescribed or wish to contact us for any other reason please email our customer service team at [hi@ourcal.com](mailto:hi@ourcal.com?subject=Legal%20Policy).

**How we will communicate with you**. If we have to contact you we will do so through the App or via your contact email address.

## Your privacy

We only use any personal data we collect through your use of the App and the Services in the ways set out in our [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy.md). By using OurCal, you agree to our privacy policy.

When you use the App, your profile, events, and messages are encrypted with end-to-end encryption (E2EE). This means that only you and the intended recipients of these can view them.

## How you may use the app

In return for your agreeing to comply with these terms you may:

* install a copy of the App onto your device and use and the App to access and use our services for your personal purposes only; and
* receive and use any free supplementary software code or updates of the App that may incorporate bug fixes, enhancements or new features.

If you don’t comply with these terms, including the acceptable use rule, we may disable your account so that you can’t use the App.

## Acceptable use

You must not:

* use the App or any Service in any unlawful manner, for any unlawful purpose, or in any manner inconsistent with these terms, or act fraudulently or maliciously, for example, by hacking into or inserting malicious code, such as viruses, or harmful data, into the App, any Service or any operating system;
* infringe our intellectual property rights or those of any third party in relation to your use of the App or any Service, including by the submission of any content that you do not have permission to send (to the extent that such use is not licensed by these terms);
* transmit any material that is defamatory, obscene, threatening, harassing, intimidating offensive or otherwise objectionable or inappropriate;
* use the App or Services to promote crime, endanger or exploit others, phish, impersonate another person or send communications that are not permitted such as bulk messaging or auto-dialling;
* use the App or any Service in a way that could damage, disable, overburden, impair or compromise our systems or security or interfere with other users; and
* collect or harvest any information or data from any Service or our systems or attempt to decipher any transmissions to or from the servers running any Service.

It is your responsibility to keep your device secure and to prevent unauthorised people from accessing your OurCal account.

## Permission to use your information

So that we can provide you with our Service, you allow us to use, reproduce, distribute, create derivative works of, display and transmit the information that you upload, send or receive through our Services. We will only use this information to provide the Services (such as allowing you to display a profile picture or send messages).

## Changes to these terms

We may need to change these terms to reflect changes in law or best practice or to deal with additional features which we introduce.

The version of these terms became effective on the date shown above. To make any revisions clear to you, we host these terms on [GitHub](https://github.com) as well as its previous versions and the changes between them.

We will give you notice of any change by sending you an email to your contact email address with details of the change or notifying you of a change when you next start the App.

If you do not accept the notified changes you will not be permitted to continue to use the App and the Service.

## Update to the app and changes to the service

From time to time we may automatically update the App and change the Service to improve performance, enhance functionality, reflect changes to the operating system or address security issues. Alternatively we may ask you to update the App for these reasons.

If you choose not to install such updates or if you opt out of automatic updates you may not be able to continue using the App and the Services.

## If someone else owns the phone or device you are using

If you install the App onto a device not owned by you, you must have the owner's permission to do so. You will be responsible for complying with these terms, whether or not you own the device.

## We may collect technical data about your device

By using the App or any of the Services, you agree to us collecting and using technical information about the devices you use the App on and related software, hardware and peripherals to improve our products and to provide any Services to you.

## Availability

We work hard to ensure that the App and the Services are available to you without interruption. There may be times, though, when the App and Services are not available or certain features are not available. This may be because the third party service providers we rely on are having difficulties or their services are not available or if we need to interrupt the Service for maintenance, to apply an upgrade or because of some reason outside of our control.

## We are not responsible for third party products or apps

The App or any Service may contain links to other independent apps, websites or products (such as your calendar) which are not provided by us. Such independent apps, sites and products are not under our control, and we are not responsible for them.

## Licence restrictions

You agree that you will:

* not rent, lease, sub-license, loan, provide, or otherwise make available, the App or the Services in any form, in whole or in part to any person without prior written consent from us;
* not copy the App or Services, except as part of the normal use of the App or where it is necessary for the purpose of back-up or operational security;
* not translate, merge, adapt, vary, alter or modify, the whole or any part of the App or Services nor permit the App or the Services or any part of them to be combined with, or become incorporated in, any other programs, except as necessary to use the App and the Services on devices as permitted in these terms;
* not disassemble, de-compile, reverse engineer or create derivative works based on the whole or any part of the App or the Services nor attempt to do any such things, except to the extent that (by virtue of sections 50B and 296A of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988) such actions cannot be prohibited because they are necessary to decompile the App to obtain the information necessary to create an independent program that can be operated with the App or with another;
* comply with all applicable technology control or export laws and regulations that apply to the technology used or supported by the App or any Service.

## Intellectual property rights

All intellectual property rights in the App and the Services throughout the world belong to us (or our licensors) and the rights in the App and the Services are licensed (not sold) to you. You have no intellectual property rights in, or to, the App or the Services other than the right to use them in accordance with these terms.

## Our responsibility to you

**Our liability is limited**. We are only liable to you when the law says we must be liable. This is if we cause death, harm or injury to a person through our negligence, if we commit fraud or are fraudulent in our representations or where the law otherwise says we can’t limit our liability. Otherwise, we have no liability to you in relation to your use of the App and Services.

**Care and skill**. We will exercise reasonable care and skill in performing the Services and making the App available for you.

**Limitations to the App and the Services**. The App and the Services are provided for general communication purposes only.

**Check that the App and the Services are suitable for you**. The App and the Services have not been developed to meet your individual requirements. Please check that the facilities and functions of the App and the Services (as described on the appstore site) meet your requirements.

**We are not responsible for events outside our control**. If our provision of the Services or support for the App or the Services is delayed by an event outside our control then we will contact you as soon as possible to let you know and we will take steps to minimise the effect of the delay. Provided we do this we will not be liable for delays caused by the event but if there is a risk of substantial delay you may contact us to end your contract with us and receive a refund for any Services you have paid for but not received.

## We may end your rights to use the app and the services if you break these terms
We may end your rights to use the App and Services at any time by contacting you if you have broken these terms in a serious way or if you don't make the payments needed to use any paid-for version of OurCal. If what you have done can be put right we will give you a reasonable opportunity to do so.

If we end your rights to use the App and Services, you must stop all activities authorised by these terms, including your use of the App and any Services, and delete the App.

## We may transfer this agreement to someone else

We may transfer our rights and obligations under these terms to another organisation. We will always tell you in writing if this happens and we will ensure that the transfer will not affect your rights under the contract.

## No rights for third parties

This agreement does not give rise to any rights under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 to enforce any term of this agreement.

## If a court finds part of this contract illegal, the rest will continue in force

Each of the paragraphs of these terms operates separately. If any court or relevant authority decides that any of them are unlawful, the remaining paragraphs will remain in full force and effect.

## Even if we delay in enforcing this contract, we can still enforce it later

Even if we delay in enforcing these terms, we can still enforce them later. If we do not insist immediately that you do anything you are required to do under these terms, or if we delay in taking steps against you in respect of your breaking this contract, that will not mean that you do not have to do those things and it will not prevent us taking steps against you at a later date.

## Which laws apply to this contract and where you may bring legal proceedings

These terms are governed by English law and you can bring legal proceedings in respect of the products in the English courts. If you live in Scotland you can bring legal proceedings in respect of the products in either the Scottish or the English courts. If you live in Northern Ireland you can bring legal proceedings in respect of the products in either the Northern Irish or the English courts.
