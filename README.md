# Onin's Legal Agreements

We host our legal agreements between you—our users—and us here on [GitHub](https://github.com/) to make them, and any changes made to them, as transparent as possible.

By doing so, you can access previous versions of each agreement and see the changes made between them. We also provide an explanation of such changes here too.
